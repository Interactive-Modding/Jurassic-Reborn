      "Dennis Nedry's habits are really starting to get under my skin. A man his age should not act like a spoiled teenager, especially given the scope of this park. The only problem is, who else is there really?",
      "Dr. Sorkin and Dr. Wu argued again today. Can these two not agree on anything? We've already made our choice, and we're sticking to it. Completing the pure DNA sequences will simply take far too long to be practical."

      "After a long and arduous legal battle, Bill Steingarten no longer has any influence over InGen as of today. And good riddance too, honestly. Now that he'll no longer be a financial burden on my company, I can finally realize my goal.",
      "Two ideal spots have been purchased from the Craftacan government, and an additional two in a sparsely populated region of Icecraft. The best architechts emeralds can buy are heading there as we speak. We spared no expense on this project, but there's no doubt we will profit enormously when we are successful.",
      "According to the most recent reports, our dig teams are also doing well, due in part to the expertise of one Dr. Alan Grant, a local palaeontologist. I even bought his most recent book for Tim's birthday."

Granted, it could use a wee adjustment or two here and there, particularly with regards to the size of the laboratory, but I'm sure they can come up with something that more appropriately suits what I wanted. Henry says that he doesn't mind either way.",

This facility is a lot more extensive than the one at Site A, capable of producing large numbers of dinosaurs at a time. The facility will be surrounded by fifty nursery enclosures, where the animals can be raised before being moved to the main park.",
      "Site B is also where we will test new species before adding them to the official park list. It is not to be a theme park, but a research station. This is where we do the real work..."
