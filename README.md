### The code is modified and built up from an older version of JurassiCraft's code, having been also worked upon by JWR's coders. Credit goes to the original JurassiCraft team for laying the foundations for the code that was expanded upon to make this project a reality.

# Contributing
Feel free to speed up development and create pull requests. Here's a guide on how to setup your workspace.

First, make a fork of this repository. When you've done that, you can clone that reposity. Depending on your installation settings, you either have to run the command in the git Bash, or the CMD/Terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/<Your Username>/RebornMod
```

When that's done, go into the newly created directory `RebornMod` and run in the console if you're on Windows:

```
gradlew.bat setupDecompWorkspace
```
Or this when you're on any other operating system (Like Mac OS X and Ubuntu):
```
./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
```
... and append the name of the IDE you use - eclipse or idea:

__Example for Windows and IDEA:__
>gradlew.bat setupDecompWorkspace idea

Now open the workspace and voilà, you can start contributing!
